    <p>The most challenging part of working with the AI was the fact that it wanted to link to a bunch
        of other pages that we were not planning on adding. It also just liked to add extra stuff
        that wasn't exactly necessary.
    </p>
    <p>The best part of working with the AI was creating the home page. It did most of the work for us
        there and generated something surprisingly pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>One thing I learned about HTML was that you can use the "&lt;aside&gt;" tag for information that
        you intend to have off to the side or as just something extra/supporting that isn't the main
    information that you are presenting</p>
    <p>One thing I learned about CSS was the .hero function that created the center box we see on
        the home page of our website.

        <p> The AI was very helpful. The part I found the most difficult was finding correct spaces to add in my own code to the page and not throw off whatever it had already put together for us. It worked out pretty well in the end though. </p>
        <p>The part that worked the best was easily how quickly and effectively it built the structure for the page. Even having to pick through the code was easier than writing everything from scratch. One thing I learned was the footer function, which does exactly what I thought it would and was much easier to use than I thought. The new CSS I leared was the subtitle function! /p>
